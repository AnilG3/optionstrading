# Options Trading Notes and Scripts

This repository is collection of my notes and iPython Notebooks that I developed while learning and trading Stock Options. During learning about Options Trading, I read quite a few books on Options strategies. As I read these books, I took notes and tried to code as much as possible. Some inspiration also came from various Options subreddits on Reddit. Most of the Notebooks are incomplete due to decline in interest and time available for option trading as I became busy with other projects.

Below is a brief description of content of relevant files.
