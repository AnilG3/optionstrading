    "#### Hedging a long Position with a Put\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the theory of option pricing is based on the idea that we can replicate an option position by dynamically trading the underlying, this is just an approximation. In practice the subtle distinctions between option behavior and the behavior of the replicating strategy are where professional traders can make money.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Volatility Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "By trading options and dynamically hedging them with the underlying, a trader can take a position that is dependent only on the difference in volatility implied by the option market and the volatility that actually occurs in the underlying during the lifetime of the option.\n",

    "## 3. Arbitrage Bounds for Option Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "The principle of no arbitrage is probably the closest thing finance has to a fundamental law. Also, known as the \"law of one price,\" this states that if two securities are same, then they will have same price. If they do not, then arbitrageurs will trade the securities and make a risk-free profit. The law of no arbitrage is somewhat self-fulfilling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes what appears to be an arbitrage opportunity is merely a situation with larger than anticipated transaction costs or execution risk (delay in second offsetting trade).\n",
    "\n",
    "A common form of arbitrage is where two securities are non identical, but have a well-defined financial relationship to construct a risk free portfolio from combination (Example: Forward contract).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Forward Contract*\n",
    "\n",
    "A stock with a current price of $S$, want to sell at a time $T$ in future. What is the price $F$, at which we would be indifferent about agreeing to sell it?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = S \\cdot e^{r T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$r$ is the risk-free interest rate. This equation can be proven by assuming it does not hold and showing that this leads to possible arbitrage profits. There are a few assumptions to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The underlying must be an asset we can actually trade, i.e. ability to buy it and sell it short. If only one of these two conditions hold, we will have an inequality rather than an equality.\n",
    "2. The interest rate to borrow and to lend are same. If this is not the case, we would arrive at no arbitrage band, instead of at single value.\n",
    "3. Holding the underlying gives no addiitonal benefit, e.g. dividend/interest/shareholder benefits. If underlying is paid a dividend. equation will be adjusted to account for present value of dividend.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F = (S - PV_{dividend}) \\cdot e^{r T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Holding the underlying doesn't incur storage costs (commodities). These costs would behave like a *negative* dividend.\n",
    "5. Interest rate is paid by an entity that will not default.\n",
    "6. Interest rate is constant. This is important when we are considering the difference between forward contracts and futures. Futures are marked to market each day and the amount of collateral a trader need to post is hence adjusted daily. If interest rates and underlyings are positively correlated, futures will be worth slightly nore than forward contracts. Practically in every case we can assume futures are priced as forwards.\n",
    "7. The future contrcat's price is *not* the expected price in the future. It is merely the price that allows no arbitrage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of arbitrage through *static replication*. Option pricing is based on the idea of *dynamic replication*, where a position needs to be rebalanced to maintain riskless nature of arbitrage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### American Options compared to European Options\n",
    "\n",
    "An American option is always worth at least as much as a European option. If we ever find an American option trading for less than an equivalent European option we can create risk-free profit by buying American option, selling European option, then holding the position until expiration. Capital letters denote American options and lowercase letters European options, $ c \\le C $ for calls and $ p \\le P $ for puts.\n",

    "#### The Maximum Value of a Put\n",
    "\n",
    "An American put can never be worth more than the strike price, $ P \\le X $, the most value a put can ever have is when underlying goes to zero, the payoff is equal to the strike.

The economists who study these deviations from perfection classify them into two classes: risk premium and inefficiencies. A **risk premium** is earned as compensation for taking a risk, and if the premium is mispriced, it will be profitable even after accepting the risk. An **inefficiency** is a trading opportunity caused by the market not noticing something. It is often impossible to know whether a given opportunity is a risk premium or an inefficiency. A risk premium can be expected to persist. By contrast, an inefficiency will last only until other people notice it.\n",

For example, if we have an option pricing model, we can continually generate a theoretical value for all of the options on a given underlying. An event-driven trade is based on a specific unusual situation. Noticing that implied volatility declines after a company releases earnings would be the basis of an event-driven trade.\n",

    "\n",
    "When a commodity has a term structure in <u>contango (long-dated futures more expensive than short-dated futures)</u>, it is profitable to short the futures. And when futures are in <u>backwardation (long dated futures cheaper than short-dated futures)</u>, it is profitable to buy futures. Essentially, the cash price is a better predictor of futures prices than futures are.\n",

    "The effect also exists for VIX futures. Simon and Campasano (2014) present evidence that the futures can be predicted by looking at the basis, i.e. if the futures are trading over the index, VIX, the futures will tend to fall, and if the futures are trading below the index, they will tend to rise (*Simon, D., and J. Campasano. 2014. “The VIX Futures Basis: Evidence and Trading Strategies.” The Journal of Derivatives 21: 54–69*).\n",

    "The VIX term structure is usually in <u>contango at low VIX levels</u> and in <u>backwardation when the VIX is high</u>. This means the term-structure anomaly is often in conflict with the mean reversion of the VIX. Mean reversion would enourage you to buy futures at low VIX levels even in the presence of contango. However, it seems that the term structure is usually a stronger predictor of futures returns. The exception would be when the VIX is at very high levels.\n",

    "This is probably why the term-structure effects fails to apply to the cross-section of equity option returns.

Ball and Brown (1968) found evidence that stock returns continue to drift in the same direction as unexpected earnings, i.e. stock prices tend to increase after earnings announcements with positive earnings surprises and decrease with negative earnings surprises. What was unexpected was that the outperformance didn't happen abruptly but accumulated over three months. The stock prices did incorporate the news but did so slowly. In fact, the prices reacted so slowly that the effect was tradable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1980s the consensus of analyst forecasts became available. This enabled the magnitude of the earnings surprise to be defined as the percentage difference between the reported EPS and the consensus forecast. Sorting stocks on the basis of this surprise gave the same result. Further, it seems that the effect of the earnings report isn't limited to the headline EPS number. The momentum created by the earnings report is a follow through of the initial price move based on the entire report, rather than being due to any single accounting number.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is most pronounced in firms that report after their direct competitors and have earnings that outperform those firms by a surprising amount (Lee, Y. 2017). Long-short stock portfolios based on the size of surprises have been shown to return 9% to 27% annually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all of the drift occurs within 9 months for small firms and within 6 month for large firms. And a disproportionate amount of the return occurs within 5 days of the earnings announcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "DellaVigna and Pollet (2009) postulate that this effect is even more pronounced on Fridays when investor attention is at its lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Trading Strategy</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "Because IV tends to be comparatively cheap after earnings releases, although this isn't enough to profit from delta-neutral volatility strategies (Chung, S., and H. Lewis. 2017), this is an effect that can be traded from the long side.\n",
    "\n",
    "For stocks with positive earnings surprises, being long a short-dated 40 delta/ 10 delta call spread is usually a cheap way to leverage PEAD. For bearish positions a 50 delta/20 delta put spread achieves the same effect while also selling one of the most expensive parts of the IV curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach is to sell a covered call or put. Although the variance premium being collected won't be significant, this method is guaranteed to profit if any drift occurs at all.\n",

    "#### Trading Equity Options over Earnings Announcement\n",
    "\n",
    "The front-expiration IV will almost always rise significantly in the weeks before a company's earnings release. After the release the IV will collapse (Patell and Wolfson, 1979). Buying options before the release is profitable (Chung and Lewis, 2017). And even in cases when the options do not increase in price, the rise in IV gives a very cheap long position where the vega profits negate most of the time decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gao et. al (2017) bought delta-neutral straddles 3 days before the earning announcement. Selling a day before the release gave a return of 1.9%, selling on the release day returned 2.60% and holding for a day after earnings had a return of 1.98%. Notably, holding the straddle for a full day after earnings had a lower return than selling on the release date. This indicates that the return on the straddle is negative after earnings are announced. As close as possible before earnings, sell the front straddle and hope that the collapse in IV compensates for the movement of the underlying.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it seems that there is a small tendency for this strategy to fare poorly with high PE stocks (He et al., 2010). However, the difference is so weak it can probably be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a link between the dispersion of analyst estimates, defined as (high estimate - low estimate) / average estimate, and profitability. Trading the effect on stocks with high dispersion is more profitable. Other signifiers of uncertianty are with higher historical volatilities, larger historical earning surprises, and more volatile earnings surprises. The strategies also perform better in these cases. The strategy was more profitable in stocks that were covered by fewer analysts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that pre-earnings long straddles are profitable makes it unlikely that this effect is due to risk premium. Separating the effect into the pre-earnings IV increase and the post-earnings IV collapse and stock price adjustment makes finding possible explanations easier. The profitability of the post-earnings straddle sales could be due to ambiguity aversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The short side of this strategy hasn't done well recently (2016-2018). Usually, selling options before situations of uncertainty is a good trade.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<u>Trading Strategy</u>**\n",
    "\n",
    "On the long side, buy the shortest-dated straddles that span the earning date. Or if the smile is relatively flat, strangles are a higher risk/reward play.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the short side, sell the shortest-dated straddles that span the earnings date. After the earnings release, either buy the straddle back (generally preferable if trade is winner), or if stock has a big move, hedge the losing leg as 100 delta. Stocks in which the earnings number is outside of the most extreme estimates are most likely to not reverse.\n",
